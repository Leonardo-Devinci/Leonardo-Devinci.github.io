# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with modern standards
- **CSS3**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure ES6+ JavaScript

## External Dependencies

- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family (weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library via CDN
- **Placeholder images**: via.placeholder.com for project mockups

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Development Approach

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Vanilla JavaScript with modern APIs (IntersectionObserver, etc.)
- No build process required - direct file serving

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized animations with CSS transforms
- Throttled scroll event handlers
- Lazy loading approach for images
- Minimal external dependencies

## Common Commands

Since this is a static website with no build process:

- **Local Development**: Open `index.html` directly in browser or use a local server
- **Testing**: Manual testing across different devices and browsers
- **Deployment**: Upload files directly to web server or static hosting service

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- CSS organized by sections (reset, variables, components)
- JavaScript uses modern ES6+ features
- Consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for CSS, camelCase for JS)
- Comments for complex functionality
